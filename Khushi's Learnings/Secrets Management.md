### What is Secrets Management?
Secrets management refers to the tools and methods used to manage digital authentication credentials (secrets), such as passwords, API keys, tokens, and encryption keys. These secrets are essential for securing access to applications, services, and sensitive parts of the IT ecosystem.

### AWS Systems Manager
