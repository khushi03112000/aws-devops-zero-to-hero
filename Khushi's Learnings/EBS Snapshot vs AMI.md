### **Is an EBS Snapshot Similar to an AMI for EC2?**  

📌 **EBS Snapshot and AMI are related but not the same.**  
While both are used for **backup and recovery**, they serve **different purposes** in AWS.

## **🔹 EBS Snapshot vs. AMI: Key Differences**

| Feature | **EBS Snapshot** | **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **What it Captures** | **Backup of an EBS volume (only storage)** | **Complete system image (OS + Apps + Config + Storage)** |
| **Used For** | Restoring or copying **only storage** | Launching a **new EC2 instance** |
| **Includes OS?** | ❌ No (Only data from the EBS volume) | ✅ Yes (Boot disk + root filesystem) |
| **Type of Backup** | Incremental backup of changes | Full system snapshot |
| **Dependency** | Tied to a **single volume** | Can include **multiple volumes** (root + attached) |
| **Usage** | Restore an EBS volume | Create new EC2 instances |

---

## **🔹 How Are They Related?**
An **AMI** usually consists of:  
1. A **root volume snapshot (EBS Snapshot)**
2. A **launch configuration** (OS, instance type, security groups, etc.)
3. **Permissions** (Who can use the AMI)

So, **an AMI contains at least one EBS snapshot**, but a snapshot alone **is not an AMI**.

## **🔹 When to Use What?**
| **Scenario** | **Use EBS Snapshot?** | **Use AMI?** |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Backup a **single volume** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Backup the **entire instance** (OS + Data) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Restore a **single volume** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Launch a **new instance with the same setup** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## **🔹 Example Use Cases**
✅ **EBS Snapshot Example:**  
- You have a **database** on an EBS volume and want to **back up just the data**.  
- Later, you can **restore** it to a new volume.  

✅ **AMI Example:**  
- You have a **configured EC2 instance (Ubuntu + Software + Configurations)**.  
- You create an **AMI** and use it to launch **identical EC2 instances**.

## **🔹 Conclusion**
🔹 **EBS Snapshots = Storage Backup**  
🔹 **AMI = Complete System Image**
